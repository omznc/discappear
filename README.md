# Discappear - A tool to wipe your Discord sins

I'll write a more compelling readme later, but here's a TL;DR:

You export your discord data, import it into this fancy little desktop app, and selectively delete all messages you ever set (with filtering!).

Now nobody will know that you sent 'I love to code in javascript" 23 times the past 6 years.

You can grab the windows release under releases, or just build it yourselfL

1. Install deps
```
bun install
```
2. Build
```
bunx tauri build
```

That's literally it. Yes, this needs a logo and some detail work.
